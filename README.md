## 🖥️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Quellkern/game-recommendation.git
   cd game-recommendation
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   - For backend:
     ```bash
     python backend/app.py
     ```
   - For frontend:
     ```bash
     streamlit run frontend/app.py  # Or use React/NPM commands
     ```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The system uses a dataset of games, including metadata (e.g., title, genre, platform) and user ratings.
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Collaborative Filtering: Recommends games based on similar users' preferences.
   - Content-Based Filtering: Suggests games similar to ones you’ve liked.
   - Hybrid Model: Combines both approaches for better accuracy.
3. **User Interaction**: Input your preferences or play history, and get a curated list of recommendations.
